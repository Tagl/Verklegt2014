Linus Torvalds 
M 
28/12/1969  
xx/xx/xxxx  
Finnish American software engineer, who was the principal force behind the development of the Linux kernel 
that became the most popular kernel for operating systems. 
He later became the chief architect of the Linux kernel and now acts as the project's coordinator. 

Alan Turing
M
23/06/1912
07/06/1954
A British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, pioneering computer scientist, mathematical biologist,
and marathon and ultra distance runner.
He was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of 
"algorithm" and "computation" with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.
Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

Donald Knuth
M
10/01/1938
xx/xx/xxxx
 An American computer scientist, mathematician, and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. 
 He is the author of the multi-volume work The Art of Computer Programming. 
 Knuth has been called the "father of the analysis of algorithms".
 He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of 
 algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. 


Robert Sedgewick
M
20/12/1946
x
A computer science professor at Princeton University and a member of the board of directors of Adobe Systems. 
Sedgewick completed his Ph.D. in 1975 under the supervision of Donald Knuth at Stanford. His thesis was about
the quicksort algorithm. In 1975–85 he served on the faculty of Brown University. 
Sedgewick was the founding Chairman (1985) of the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University and 
is currently still a Professor of Computer Science at Princeton. He was a visiting researcher at Xerox PARC, 
Institute for Defense Analyses and INRIA.

Ada Lovelace
F
10/12/1815
27/11/1852
An English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer,
the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first
algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine.
Because of this, she is often described as the world's first computer programmer.

Bill Gates
M
28/10/1955
x
An American business magnate, philanthropist, investor, computer programmer, and inventor. 
Gates is the former chief executive and chairperson of Microsoft, the world’s largest personal-computer
software company, which he co-founded with Paul Allen.  
He is consistently ranked in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.

Rudolf Bayer
M
07/05/1939
x
A German computer scientist. 
He is noted for inventing three data sorting structures: the B-tree (with Edward M. McCreight), 
the UB-tree (with Volker Markl) and the red-black tree.

Guido van Rossum
M
31/01/1956
x
 A Dutch computer programmer who is best known as the author of the Python programming language.

Bjarne Stroustrup
M
30/12/1950
x
A Danish computer scientist, most notable for the creation and development of the widely used C++ programming language.


Dennis Ritchie
M
09/09/1941
12/10/2011
An American computer scientist. He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson,
the Unix operating system.
Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 
and the National Medal of Technology from President Clinton in 1999.
